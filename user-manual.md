## What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?

- I come across as being pretty laid back and that's intentional, but I'm really an emotional being when it comes down to it. Chances are good you won't see much raw emotion from me unless I want you to see it.
- I'm single threaded which makes context switching exhausting. On the flip side, when I'm focused on something, you know I'm focused on it and only it.
- I sometimes have difficulty staying in the present because I enjoy thinking about what's ahead.
- I love stories. One of my favorite things is experiencing a story for the first time.
- I'm a jack of all trades, not because I can't master one, but because learning excites me.
- I like to work, and when I'm not working I like to think about work. Unless I'm thinking about beer. If I'm drinking beer or thinking about beer, I'm only drinking beer and thinking about beer.
- I hate disappointing people.
- I often say yes when I should say no.
- I sometimes trust too easily.
- I'm not that great at self-care.
- I change my mind, a lot, particularly when situations and/or information change.
- I'm not afraid to be wrong and will admit when I am.
- I need time to prepare for what I say before I'm going to say it.
- I lead from the trenches.
- I do what I say I'm going to do.

## What are your quirks?

## What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?

- Just because you don't see me take a position on a certain thing doesn't mean I don't have an opinion about that thing. It just means my opinion is weakly held or not yet fully formed.
- You'll hear me say that I dislike meetings, and you'll probably hear it a lot. What that really means is I dislike meetings that don't add value. Either we make a meeting valuable or we get rid of the meeting.
- I will often avoid getting in the weeds. I do this because I trust the people who are in the weeds to handle the details and surface what's important rather than getting in the weeds myself.

- Everything else
    1. Slack
    2. Text/Email

## What's the best way to convince you to do something?

## How do you like to give feedback?

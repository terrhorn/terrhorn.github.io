<h2 id="strengths">Strengths</h2>
<p>Futuristic - Restorative - Learner - Achiever - Strategic</p>
<p>These aren't made up. <a

<h2 id="what-are-some-honest-unfiltered-things-about-you">What are some
honest, unfiltered things about you?</h2>
<ul>
<li>I come across as being pretty laid back and that's intentional, but
I'm really an emotional being when it comes down to it. Chances are good
you won't see much raw emotion from me unless I want you to see it.</li>
<li>I'm single threaded which makes context switching exhausting. On the
flip side, when I'm focused on something, you know I'm focused on it and
only it.</li>
<li>I sometimes have difficulty staying in the present because I enjoy
thinking about what's ahead.</li>
<li>I love stories. One of my favorite things is experiencing a story
for the first time.</li>
<li>I'm a jack of all trades, not because I can't master one, but
because learning excites me.</li>
<li>I like to work, and when I'm not working I like to think about work.
Unless I'm thinking about beer. If I'm drinking beer or thinking about
beer, I'm only drinking beer and thinking about beer.</li>
<li>I hate disappointing people.</li>
<li>I often say yes when I should say no.</li>
<li>I sometimes trust too easily.</li>
<li>I'm not that great at self-care.</li>
<li>I change my mind, a lot, particularly when situations and/or
information change.</li>
<li>I'm not afraid to be wrong and will admit when I am.</li>
<li>I need time to prepare for what I say before I'm going to say
it.</li>
<li>I lead from the trenches.</li>
<li>I do what I say I'm going to do.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-drives-you-nuts">What drives you nuts?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Being forced to keep bad secrets.</li>

them.</li>
<li>People who don't pay attention when being spoken to.</li>
<li>Perpetual tardiness.</li>
<li>Broken promises.</li>
<li>Wasting time.</li>
<li>Agenda-less meetings.</li>
<li>Bit rot.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-your-quirks">What are your quirks?</h2>
<ul>

two.</li>
<li>I can be stubborn when I'm tired.</li>
<li>I enjoy shielding others from distractions.</li>
<li>I am helpful to a fault.</li>
<li>I like to laugh at my own stupidity.</li>

<li>I don't like the spotlight.</li>
<li>I am terrible at celebrating.</li>
<li>I don't like cheese, mushrooms, or anything that came from a
pond/river/lake/ocean.</li>
<li>I like to purge things.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-can-people-earn-an-extra-gold-star-with-you">How can people
earn an extra gold star with you?</h2>
<ul>
<li>By chipping in to help others without being asked.</li>
<li>By putting others before themselves.</li>
<li>By going out of their way to communicate effectively, even if it
means over-communicating.</li>
<li>By asking questions. Lots of questions.</li>

<h2
id="what-are-some-things-that-people-might-misunderstand-about-you-that-you-should-clarify">What
are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you
should clarify?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Just because you don't see me take a position on a certain thing
doesn't mean I don't have an opinion about that thing. It just means my
opinion is weakly held or not yet fully formed.</li>
<li>You'll hear me say that I dislike meetings, and you'll probably hear
it a lot. What that really means is I dislike meetings that don't add
value. Either we make a meeting valuable or we get rid of the
meeting.</li>
<li>I will often avoid getting in the weeds. I do this because I trust
the people who are in the weeds to handle the details and surface what's
important rather than getting in the weeds myself.</li>

			<h4 class="text-info">Pre-startups</h4>
			<p><a href="http://www.kent.edu" target="_blank">Kent State University</a> alumnus.</p>
			<p>Senior Developer at New Media Communications. Lead Developer for Bush for President (2000), Bloomberg for Mayor (2001), the Republican National Committee, and numerous other GOP candidates and organizations. Don't read too much into the politics. There's a reason I'm not in that world anymore.</p>
			<p>Consultant at E-merging Technologies Group. Met my mentor, worked with great people, had a blast doing so. You can say they prepared me for what was next. Speaking of...</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h4 class="text-info">Startups</h4>
			<p>Founded BlueEye Systems (CEO). Co-Founded <a href="http://hornernetworks.com" target="_blank">Horner Networks</a> (CTO) and <a href="http://mysendreceivenow.com/" target="_blank">SendReceive</a> (CTO). All bootstrapped. All profitable. Horner Networks and SendReceive are still in operation to this day.</p>
			<p>Co-Founded Spent (CEO/CTO). Got accepted into the inaugural class of <a href="http://ironyardventures.com/" target="_blank">The Iron Yard</a> accelerator. Raised an angel round. Rebranded as <a href="https://angel.co/relify" target="_blank">Relify</a> and pivoted into the awesome world of machine learning. Unfortunately didn't survive. Learned. Got stronger.</p>
			<p>Joined <a href="http://www.chartspan.com/" target="_blank">ChartSpan</a> (CTO). Engineered an awesome vision. Worked with <a href="http://www.chartspan.com/team" target="_blank">awesome people</a>. Ran into an instance of incompatibility. Moved on.
			<p>Joined <a href="http://keen.io/" target="_blank">Keen IO</a> as a Data Scientist. Realized that my heart was still in the guts of all the things, and was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to move over to Engineering as a Individual Contributor / Software Engineer where I worked on our Middleware, DevOps and On-Call teams. I must have done something right because I was promoted to VP of Engineering where I am responsible for leading our engineering team. What does leading our engineering team entail? I oversee our operational readiness and responsiveness as well as the execution and delivery of internal engineering projects, new products, and new features, in addition to managing our infrastructure budgets and vendor relationships. More importantly, I am a coach and mentor, and provide guidance and encouragement to ensure each one of our engineers is setup for success in their roles at Keen, and for whatever might come next once their time at Keen is done.

			<h4 class="text-info">Code and Infrastructure</h4>
			<p>Java hacker since college. Lived too many years in the world of ASP, C#, ASP.NET and SQL Server. Escaped.</p>
			<p>Fell in love with Ruby, Scala and Objective-C. Found my love of programming again. Picked up Python along the way. You know, because data.</p>
			<p>Have been working with cloud technologies since they hit the interwebs. AWS and I know each other well.</p>
			<p>Dove into the world of open source head first. Became obsessed with Lucene, OpenNLP, Solr, Hadoop and just about every other open source big data/search technology.</p>
			<p>Got the itch to hack on some cryptographic libraries, OpenPGP and BouncyCastle in particular. Thanks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden" target="_blank">Ed</a>.</p>
			<p>Quite fascinated by the future of the block chain.</p>

			<p>Father to three awesome children. Youngest two are twins. All you parents of multiples know what I'm talking about. No, I don't need to say it.</p> 
			<p>Husband to the best wife a man could ask for. See above.</p>
			<p>Used to perform ridiculous feats of endurance. Finished the <a href="http://www.americantriple-t.com/tt/index.htm" target="_blank">American Triple-T</a> three times. Finished countless other short/long distance events in between.</p>

Slept for a week.</p>
			<p>Decided a week of misery riding across the country wasn't enough, so I <a href="http://www.raceacrossamerica.org/raamx/rcracer.php?s_N_Year_ID=40&s_N_Entry_ID=3453" target="_blank">rode 928 miles across the West in 66 hours and 18 minutes with my good friend</a> to raise money for <a href="http://www.lebronjamesfamilyfoundation.org/page/wheelsforeducation" target="_blank">the LeBron James Family Foundation's Wheels for Education</a> program. Slept for a day or two before watching my NBA team win its first championship on my 39th birthday. Speaking of...</p>
			<p>Born and raised in Northeast Ohio. Tortured by Cleveland sports franchises as far back as I can remember. This space used to be occupied by the phrase "Please guys, just one before I die", but we got one. I don't know what that means for my life expectancy.</p>
			<p>Resident of the best kept secret in the South. Seriously, <a href="http://www.visitgreenvillesc.com/" target="_blank">this place is awesome</a>.</p>
			<p>Also, I like craft beer. <a href="https://untappd.com/user/terrhorn" target="_blank">I like it a lot</a>. <a href="https://liabilitybrewing.co/" target="_blank">A lot a lot</a>.</p>

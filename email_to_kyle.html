				Date: Wed, 7 May 2014 10:47:40 -0400<br/>
				Subject: Follow up from our conversation<br/>
				To: Kyle Wild<br/>
				<br/>
				Hey Kyle,
				<br/><br/>
				I appreciate you taking the time to call me back the other day, and hope the day ended well. You could have easily just ignored the call and gone about your meetings, which is probably what most guys in your situation would have done. The fact that you didn't, and the fact that you referred to what you were doing as being more urgent, and not more important, is one of many reasons I hold you in high regard. You clearly put people first and I love that.
				<br/><br/>
				I took the day yesterday to ponder what you guys are working on, how I might fit, and what the future may hold for such a relationship. I had to step back a few times while I was going through your docs because my mind kept wandering from the task at hand to stuff I could build on your platform. I love what you guys have built and see a hundred different ways that the developer in me can use it. That being said, me coming up with different ways to use the platform or ideas for some future roadmap don't really mean much because I don't know what problems you or your customers need solved today. I have no doubt that the vision that you and your team have for the company is vast, but the reality of what customers need and the vision a startup has for the future often don't align. At least initially. That being the case, I pose the follow questions:
				<br/><br/>
				What problems can I help you solve?
				<br/><br/>
				What problems can I help your customers solve?
				<br/><br/>
				I'm a problem solver pure and simple. I can't say that I'm an expert in any technology in your stack, but that's never kept me from solving any problem I've encountered in the past. I pride myself on being able to find and become advanced in the best tool for the job at hand. I swapped out Mahout and Elastic MapReduce for Solr as the core of our machine learning stack in less than a month after I learned from a friend at a hackathon that using a search engine for machine learning was more adaptable and efficient for our use case. I picked up Ruby and Scala last year specifically so I could build a platform that would enable me to attract talented engineers because I knew I wouldn't be able to build the team and culture I wanted to build using C# on a Microsoft stack. I refuse to pretend that I know everything, and am open and willing to learn anything, your stack included.
				<br/><br/>
				I've been in the startup world long enough to know that I've learned to love the ambiguity. The ups and downs don't phase me, they're expected, and I love the challenge that every new day brings. I've been a CEO/CTO a few times now and would bring that leadership and experience to the table with me. I understand how important it is to have people with experience to lean on. I've worn every hat that an entrepreneur can wear, and have succeeded when the odds of success were nil. I have also failed many times and am extremely grateful for what those experiences have taught me. Those are lessons that are invaluable and that I believe would help any team that I join. 
				<br/><br/>
				I would seek to apply everything I've learned in all of my startup experiences, technical and otherwise, in every aspect of any role I might take on. I would also seek to provide leadership to anyone who may need it. I've learned to embrace leadership from wherever it may manifest, and that every member of a team leads at some time or another in their own individual way. Understanding this has made and continues to make me a better leader.
				<br/><br/>
				I understand that a remote environment isn't necessarily the best fit for a culture such as yours, nor may it be for any team, but I firmly believe whether or not it succeeds depends on the passion and compatibility of the people involved. I've worked remotely almost my entire career and know the pitfalls well. I've also come to love working in the same room with those that I'm in the trenches with as it creates bonds that can never be broken. Making it work remotely will require striking and maintaining balance. There's no magic solution, so we'd have to find one that works for us. I'd want to come out to SF as often as possible to make sure I'm a big part of the team. It won't be easy, but it doesn't have to be difficult. If the opportunity is right, and the fit is there, there's always a way to make things work.
				<br/><br/>
				John had originally sent me the results of his Strengths Finder assessment a few years back before we started Spent/Relify to give me some insight into the person that he is and how I could best utilize him in our team. We ended up taking a different more weakness oriented assessment and I forgot about Strengths Finder. Seeing that you and your team hold Strengths Finder in such high regard made me curious and pushed me to read the book and take the assessment yesterday. I wanted to 1) see if it identified why John and I made such a good team, and 2) if it was accurate about what I and others perceive my strengths to be. You're already well aware that it nails everyone's strengths and now I am too. Mine was dead on. My top five:
				<br/><br/>
				Futuristic<br/>
				Restorative<br/>
				Learner<br/>
				Achiever<br/>
				Strategic
				<br/><br/>
				I'm getting into TL;DR territory now, but wanted to give you as honest and concise a representation of myself as is possible using email as the medium. I love what you and the team are doing at Keen IO, and would enjoy another conversation if you're open to having one. I'll even come to SF on my dime for it. If not, that's cool too. I'd still love to help in any way that I can even if we don't move forward.
				<br/><br/>

				P.S. You can grab all of my info (LinkedIn, AngelList, GitHub nerd/startup chops) from terryhorner.github.io if you need it. Most of my contributions on GitHub are private and locked down with my former companies, but I can get you some code samples if needed.
				<br/><br/>
				I can fit any of the technical roles you currently have listed on your AngelList jobs profile, and probably some you don't. I'm also extremely adept at handling multiple roles where there's overlap, so I'll throw that out there too.
